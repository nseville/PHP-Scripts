This Repo is a collection of reusable scripts I have wrote. These are intended for personal use but if you
are interested in using or modifying them feel free. You should provide a linkback to my GitHub account if you choose to do so.

If you do choose to use them I make no guarantees of future functionality and it is up to you to test and debug, I will not assist in troubleshooting.
